This is a responsive timed quiz that I made using html, css, and javascript. Most of the code is in Javascript. The quiz is multiple choice. Depending on the users choice, the score will increase or time will decrease. When the user starts the game, one question and four answers are diplayed at a time. To confirm the answer, press the next button. On the last question, the next button changes to finish. When the user clicks on finish or time runs out, your final score will be displayed. There is an input field displayed to keep track of the users score. When the user clicks submit, the high scores will be displayed. The quiz is responsive and styled.
